# UndoStack-Assignment
Create a class called UndoStack. This stack is intended to be used for the undo operation in another application. It
should have the property that it remembers at most the last 100 elements pushed into it. So, for example, if
there were 101 push operations it would “forget” the oldest of these and if a pop happens the 2nd pushed
element will be popped, etc. Write complete C++ code for this class.
